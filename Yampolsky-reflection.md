#Yampolsky Reflection

*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Just getting familiar with the git and github workflow

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

it was good practice for everything I had already learned, plus i learned about fetch and merge which I hadn't seen before

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

asked my pair and guide for clarity on a number of concepts and syntax/best practices.

*What still confuses you about Git?

I'll need a little more practice till it becomes second nature but overall i feel ok :)

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was overall positive, but i did feel a bit akward due to the new experience. I expect this to get better over time as I get used to pairing.
